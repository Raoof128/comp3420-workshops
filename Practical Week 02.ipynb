    "1. Follow this invitation link and accept the invitation: https://classroom.github.com/a/JzzNHoZ_2. The link may ask you to sign in to GitHub (if you haven't signed in earlier). If you don't have a GitHub account, you will need to register.\n",
    "3. Once you have logged in with GitHub, you may need to select your email address to associate your GitHub account with your email address (if you haven't done it in a previous COMP3420 activity). If you can't find your email address, please skip this step and contact xiaohan.yu@mq.edu.au so that he can do the association manually.\n",
    "4. Wait a minute or two, and refresh the browser until it indicates that your assignment repository has been created. Your repository is private to you, and you have administration privileges. Only you and the lecture will have access to it. The repository will be listed under the list of repositories belonging to this offering of COMP3420: https://github.com/orgs/2025S2COMP64203420/repositories5. Your assignment repository will include starter code that you can use for the exercises below. Clone your repository into a folder in your computer.\n",

    "1. **Implement functions and upload the implementation to github classroom**. The exercises will have associated automated tests. To run these tests, please commit your changes and push the changes to your repository. This will initiate the automated tests, and you will receive the test results. There are no marks associated with these tests, but they will help you get used to the environment that you will use for the assignments.\n",

    "## Analysis of Webcam Digit Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The webcam classification system performance depends on several factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Implementation Features:\n",
    "1. **Image Preprocessing Pipeline:**\n",
    "   - Converts webcam RGB image to grayscale\n",
    "   - Crops to center region to focus on the digit\n",
    "   - Resizes to 28Ã—28 pixels (MNIST format)\n",
    "   - Inverts colors (black text on white background â†’ white text on black background)\n",
    "   - Normalizes pixel values to [0,1] range\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Real-time Capture:**\n",
    "   - Uses OpenCV to access webcam\n",
    "   - Interactive capture with spacebar\n",
    "   - Visual feedback showing original, grayscale, and processed images\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Performance Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size and Position Effects:**\n",
    "- **Size**: Numbers that are too small or too large relative to the frame will be poorly resized to 28Ã—28\n",
    "- **Position**: Off-center digits may be cropped incorrectly, affecting recognition\n",
    "- **Solution**: The code crops to center region to mitigate positioning issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Factors Affecting Classification:**\n",
    "- **Lighting conditions**: Poor lighting can affect contrast\n",
    "- **Writing style**: MNIST digits are quite standardized; very different handwriting styles may not work well\n",
    "- **Paper quality**: Wrinkled or non-white backgrounds can interfere\n",
    "- **Camera quality**: Low resolution cameras will provide poor input\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations for Better Results:\n",
    "1. Write digits large and centered in the camera view\n",
    "2. Use thick, dark pen on clean white paper\n",
    "3. Ensure good, even lighting\n",
    "4. Hold paper steady and flat\n",
    "5. Try different distances from camera to find optimal size\n"
